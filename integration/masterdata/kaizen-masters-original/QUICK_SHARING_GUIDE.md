# Quick Sharing Guide
## What to Tell Other Modules & What Files to Share

### üöÄ Simple 3-Step Process

#### Step 1: Share the Package
**Send:** The entire `master-data-integration` folder (as ZIP attachment)
**Message:** "Here's our master data integration framework - start with README.md"

#### Step 2: Key Points to Communicate
**Tell them:**
- "Don't create your own lookup tables - reuse our 5 existing master types first"
- "If you need new data, use our request format so other modules can benefit too"
- "Direct database access is recommended for best performance"
- "Timeline: 1 week for analysis, 1 week for implementation"

#### Step 3: Set Expectations
**Timeline:** 2 weeks total
**Contact:** dev@kaizen.com for technical questions
**Next Step:** Completed request format within 1 week

Hi [Team],

We've created a framework to share master data across KaizenFlow modules. Instead of creating your own sites/departments/customers tables, you can reuse ours.

**Attached:** Complete integration documentation
**Start with:** README.md file
**Goal:** Avoid duplicate data, maintain consistency

**Next step:** Review existing masters and send us your requirements using our standard format.

### üéØ What Success Looks Like

**Module team response:** "We reviewed the catalog and can reuse 80% of existing data. Here's our request for the remaining 20%."

**Key message:** "Check what exists first, then request what's missing."
