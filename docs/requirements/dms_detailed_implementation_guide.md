# Detailed Live Environment Implementation Guide

## Basic Requirements (B-1 to B-8)

**B-1: Single Repository for Controlled Documents**  
In the live manufacturing environment, all controlled documents (Policies, SOPs, Work Instructions, PFMEAs, Control Plans, Drawings, and Forms) are stored in a centralized database with strict version control. When a Quality Engineer uploads a new Work Instruction for bus seat assembly, the system automatically assigns a unique document ID, validates metadata completeness, and places it in "Draft" status within the unified repository. Shop floor operators access documents exclusively through this central system via QR code scans on their tablets, ensuring they never work with outdated or uncontrolled copies. The system maintains complete segregation between controlled (approved) and uncontrolled (draft/obsolete) documents, with clear visual indicators and access restrictions preventing accidental use of non-current versions.

**B-2: Document Metadata & Auto-Numbering**  
When creating a new Control Plan for GSRTC seat welding, the system automatically generates document number "CP-2025-0124" following the configured format "CP-{YYYY}-{####}". Required metadata fields (title, document type, process area, revision number, owner, approval status, effective date) must be completed before the document can progress beyond draft status. The auto-numbering system ensures no duplicate document IDs across all sites and maintains sequential integrity even during concurrent document creation by multiple users. Metadata validation rules prevent common errors like missing Safety Characteristics tags or incorrect process area assignments, while search indexing enables instant retrieval by any metadata field combination.

**B-3: Document Lifecycle Management**  
A typical document workflow begins when a Manufacturing Engineer creates a draft Work Instruction, which automatically notifies designated reviewers (Quality Manager, Line Lead) via WhatsApp and email. The document progresses through Draft → Under Review → Approved → Effective → Obsolete states with mandatory e-signatures at each approval gate. During the "Under Review" phase, reviewers can add comments, request changes, or approve, with all actions logged in an immutable audit trail. Once approved, the system schedules the effective date, automatically notifies affected personnel, and generates KaizenTasks for training completion. The lifecycle engine enforces business rules like mandatory PSO (Product Safety Officer) approval for safety-critical documents and prevents unauthorized status changes.

**B-4: Controlled PDF Output with Watermarks & QR Codes**  
Every approved document generates a controlled PDF with embedded watermarks showing "CONTROLLED COPY" status, effective date, and revision number. A unique QR code on each page links directly to the current version in the DMS, allowing instant verification of document currency on the shop floor. When a Line Supervisor prints a Work Instruction for Station 12, the PDF includes a header watermark "VALID UNTIL: 2025-12-31" and footer QR code that mobile devices can scan to confirm this is the latest revision. The system tracks all PDF generations with timestamps and user identities, while uncontrolled prints from draft versions display prominent "DRAFT - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE" watermarks to prevent accidental shop floor usage.

**B-5: Search & Filtering Capabilities**  
The advanced search interface allows users to find documents using any combination of criteria: document ID ("WI-2025-0089"), title keywords ("seat belt anchor"), process area ("Welding"), document type ("Work Instruction"), revision ("Rev 3"), or approval status ("Effective"). A Production Supervisor searching for "belt anchor welding" instantly receives all related Work Instructions, PFMEAs, and Control Plans currently effective in the Welding department. Search results display document thumbnails, metadata summaries, and current status with direct links for viewing or downloading. Saved search filters enable team-specific dashboards, such as Quality Engineers seeing only documents awaiting their review, while Line Leads view documents effective in their assigned areas.

**B-6: Immutable Audit Trail**  
Every document action generates timestamped, tamper-proof audit entries capturing user identity, action taken, IP address, and relevant metadata changes. When Safety Engineer Priya Sharma approves Control Plan CP-2025-0156 on January 15, 2025 at 14:23:17 from workstation 192.168.1.45, this information becomes permanently recorded in the audit log with cryptographic integrity verification. The audit trail tracks not just major lifecycle events but also minor actions like document views, search queries, and metadata edits, providing complete traceability for internal and external audits. Audit reports can be generated for specific time periods, users, or document types, with automatic export to Excel for auditor review and regulatory compliance documentation.

**B-7: Retention Rules Management**  
The system automatically enforces document retention policies based on document type and safety criticality: standard documents retain for 3 years post-obsolescence, while PPAP and safety-critical documents retain for 10+ years. When Control Plan CP-2024-0089 becomes obsolete on March 1, 2025, the system calculates its deletion date as March 1, 2035 due to its safety-critical classification. Automated retention workflows generate warning notifications at 90, 30, and 7 days before scheduled deletion, allowing document owners to extend retention if needed for ongoing projects or legal requirements. The retention engine maintains secure archived copies even after deletion, accessible only to authorized personnel with audit logging for compliance verification.

## Efficiency Requirements (E-1 to E-10)

**E-1A: Simple Read-&-Understood Acknowledgment**  
When Work Instruction WI-2025-0067 becomes effective, the system automatically sends WhatsApp notifications to all 23 operators on Assembly Line 2 with direct links to the document and a simple "I Have Read & Understood" button. Each operator clicks the acknowledgment after reviewing the document, which captures their user ID, timestamp (2025-01-15 14:23:17), IP address, and creates an immutable audit record. The system tracks completion rates in real-time dashboard showing 18 of 23 operators completed (78%) with automatic escalation alerts to Line Supervisor when completion falls below 95% threshold before effective date. This simple approach ensures rapid deployment while maintaining full audit trail for ISO compliance, with individual acknowledgment records accessible for internal and external audits.

**E-1B: Quiz-based Competency Training**  
For safety-critical documents like welding procedures or PFMEA changes, the system presents 3-5 targeted questions about key safety points, process parameters, and quality requirements after document review. Operators must achieve minimum 80% pass score (4/5 correct answers) with unlimited retakes allowed, while the system tracks attempt history and time-to-competency metrics. Quiz questions are automatically generated from document content using AI analysis of critical procedures, torque specifications, safety warnings, and quality checkpoints, with manual review and approval by subject matter experts. Failed attempts generate additional training resources and supervisor notifications, while successful completion enables work authorization and feeds into individual competency profiles for annual performance reviews and skill gap analysis.

**E-2: Safety Gate (PSO) Auto-Enforcement**  
The Safety Gate engine automatically analyzes document content and metadata to identify changes affecting safety-critical characteristics like seat belt anchor points, structural welds, or airbag compatibility zones. When Design Engineer submits revision to Drawing DWG-2025-0234 modifying seat belt mounting dimensions, the system immediately flags this as safety-critical and routes to Product Safety Officer Rajesh Kumar for mandatory PSO approval. The document cannot progress to "Effective" status without PSO e-signature, regardless of other approvals received. Safety Gate rules are configurable per document type and process area: welding procedures require PSO review for any dimensional changes >2mm, while assembly instructions trigger PSO review for any new fastener specifications or torque requirements affecting passenger safety systems.

**E-3: Linked Documents Integrity Management**  
The system maintains relationship mappings between PFMEAs, Control Plans, and Work Instructions, automatically validating consistency when any linked document changes. When Process Engineer updates PFMEA PF-2025-0045 to add new failure mode "Weld Porosity," the system checks that corresponding Control Plan CP-2025-0156 includes appropriate inspection requirements and related Work Instruction WI-2025-0078 reflects updated quality checks. If linkage gaps are detected, the system prevents document approval and generates tasks for owners to update dependent documents. Cross-reference validation includes dimensional specifications, process parameters, inspection frequencies, and safety requirements, ensuring that a change in one document properly cascades through the entire process documentation chain without creating orphaned or conflicting instructions.

**E-4: Effective Date Scheduler & Readiness Check**  
Before any document becomes effective, the system performs comprehensive readiness validation: training completion rates >95%, required safety approvals obtained, linked documents updated, and physical controlled copies distributed to required locations. For Control Plan CP-2025-0189 scheduled effective January 30, 2025, the system monitors training progress and generates daily status reports showing 87% completion rate on January 25, triggering automatic escalation to Production Manager. The scheduler can automatically delay effective dates if readiness criteria aren't met, preventing production disruptions from incomplete implementation. Integration with shift schedules ensures document changeovers occur during planned maintenance windows or shift transitions rather than mid-production, minimizing operational impact while maintaining compliance requirements.

**E-5: Shop Floor Kiosk/Handheld Access**  
Manufacturing stations are equipped with ruggedized tablets displaying current effective documents for that specific work area, automatically filtering content based on station assignments and operator competency levels. When Operator scanning QR code at Station 15, the system displays only documents relevant to current production model (GSRTC Standard Seat), verified effective revisions, and appropriate language preference (Marathi/English). Document access logs track which operators viewed which documents at what times, supporting traceability requirements and enabling correlation with quality issues or process deviations. The mobile interface provides offline caching of critical documents during network outages, with automatic synchronization when connectivity returns, ensuring continuous access to controlled information even during infrastructure maintenance periods.

**E-6: Controlled Copy Ledger Management**  
The system maintains detailed tracking of all physical controlled copies distributed across manufacturing areas, with unique serial numbers and assigned custodians for each printed document. When Quality Supervisor requests controlled copy of Work Instruction WI-2025-0091 for Assembly Line 4, the system generates Copy #CC-00789, records Line Lead Amit Patel as custodian, sets expiry date matching document effective period, and creates automatic retrieval task 7 days before expiration. Physical copy locations are mapped in facility layout diagrams with periodic audit cycles generating tasks for custodians to verify copy currency and condition. When documents are revised, the system automatically generates retrieval tasks for all outstanding controlled copies, preventing outdated physical documents from remaining in circulation.

**E-7: Periodic Review Cycle with KaizenTasks Reminders**  
Document review schedules are automatically calculated based on document type classification: Policies reviewed annually, SOPs every 18 months, Work Instructions every 24 months, with safety-critical documents having accelerated 12-month cycles. The system generates KaizenTasks reminders at 90, 60, and 30 days before review due dates, escalating through owner → supervisor → manager hierarchy if not acknowledged. When Policy POL-2025-0012 approaches its January 2026 review date, document owner receives WhatsApp notification with direct link to review interface, pre-populated with document history, recent changes, and stakeholder feedback for efficient review completion. Review workflows include impact assessment questions, stakeholder consultation requirements, and mandatory management approval for any substantive changes, ensuring systematic evaluation of document currency and effectiveness.

**E-8: Dashboards & KPIs Monitoring**  
Real-time management dashboards display critical metrics including training completion percentages by department, documents overdue for review, average approval cycle times, and safety sign-off compliance rates. Quality Manager's daily dashboard shows 23 documents pending review (3 overdue), 89% Read-&-Understood completion rate for this month's effective documents, and average approval cycle time of 4.2 days against target of 5 days. Automated alerts trigger when KPIs exceed thresholds: <85% training completion generates escalation to Plant Manager, while >7-day approval cycles trigger process improvement investigations. Dashboard data feeds into Management Review presentations and supports ISO audit evidence requirements, with exportable reports and trend analysis for continuous improvement initiatives and resource planning decisions.

**E-9: Bulk Import/Legacy Migration Utility**  
The migration utility processes legacy document repositories through intelligent content analysis, extracting metadata from filenames, folder structures, and document content to populate DMS fields accurately. When migrating 1,247 existing Work Instructions from shared network drives, the system analyzes filename patterns like "WI_Welding_SeatFrame_Rev3_20240615.pdf" to automatically extract document type (WI), process area (Welding), title (SeatFrame), revision (Rev3), and creation date (2024-06-15). Content scanning identifies safety-critical keywords, linked document references, and approval signatures to establish proper document relationships and status classification. Migration workflows include validation checkpoints, duplicate detection, and manual review queues for documents requiring human verification, ensuring data integrity while accelerating the transition from legacy systems to centralized DMS control.

**E-10: Where-Used/Impact Analysis**  
Before approving changes to Control Plan CP-2025-0078, the impact analysis engine automatically identifies all dependent documents: 4 related Work Instructions, 2 PFMEA references, 3 inspection forms, and 12 training modules that could be affected by proposed changes. Visual relationship graphs display document interconnections with color-coded impact severity: red for mandatory updates, yellow for recommended reviews, green for information-only notifications. The analysis extends to operational impacts, showing affected production lines, required operator retraining, and estimated implementation costs. When Safety Engineer proposes torque specification change in CP-2025-0078, the system calculates that 67 operators across 3 shifts require retraining, 4 calibrated torque tools need verification, and 2 weeks lead time needed for full implementation, enabling informed decision-making about change timing and resource allocation.

## Good-to-Have Features (G-1 to G-7)

**G-1: AI Metadata Pre-fill & Content QA**  
Advanced AI algorithms analyze uploaded document content to automatically suggest metadata values, identify missing safety specifications, and flag potential compliance issues before human review. When Process Engineer uploads a new welding procedure, the AI system scans the content and suggests document type (SOP), process area (Welding), safety criticality (High due to structural applications), and required review cycle (12 months for safety-critical). Content analysis identifies missing elements like torque specifications, inspection frequencies, or PPE requirements, generating specific recommendations for document completion. The AI learning engine continuously improves suggestions based on historical document patterns and reviewer feedback, while maintaining human oversight for all critical decisions and metadata assignments.

**G-2: Auto-Translation Sync for Multilingual Support**  
The translation management system maintains synchronized versions of documents in English and Marathi, automatically flagging translation updates needed when source documents change and providing workflow tools for qualified translators to maintain content consistency. When Work Instruction WI-2025-0156 is revised in English to update torque specifications from 45Nm to 50Nm, the system immediately marks the Marathi version as "Translation Required" and creates translation tasks for certified technical translators. Translation workflows include technical term glossaries, consistency checking against previous translations, and mandatory review by bilingual technical experts before publication. Both language versions maintain identical document IDs and revision tracking, with clear indicators showing translation status and ensuring shop floor operators always access current information in their preferred language.

**G-3: 3-Way CAD Diff & Markup Viewer**  
The integrated CAD comparison tool enables visual analysis of drawing changes across multiple revisions, highlighting dimensional modifications, added/removed features, and annotation changes with color-coded overlays and detailed change summaries. When Design Engineer submits Drawing DWG-2025-0234 Rev 4, reviewers can instantly compare against Rev 3 and Rev 2 to understand change evolution and cumulative impacts. The markup interface allows reviewers to add comments, questions, and approval annotations directly on drawing views, with all markup history preserved for audit trails. Advanced analysis features calculate affected manufacturing processes, required tooling changes, and inspection point modifications, enabling comprehensive impact assessment before drawing approval and release to production.

**G-4: Mobile Offline Mode with Conflict Resolution**  
The mobile application maintains local cached copies of critical documents for each operator's assigned work areas, enabling continued access during network outages or connectivity issues, with intelligent synchronization and conflict resolution when network connectivity returns. During planned maintenance of plant WiFi systems, Assembly Line operators retain access to their assigned Work Instructions, Quality Checklists, and Safety Procedures through offline mode, with all document access and training activity logged locally. When connectivity returns, the system automatically synchronizes offline activities, resolves any data conflicts through configurable business rules, and updates local caches with document changes that occurred during offline periods. Conflict resolution prioritizes safety-critical information and maintains audit trail integrity while minimizing operational disruptions.

**G-5: REST/GraphQL API for External Integration**  
Comprehensive APIs enable seamless integration with customer portals, supplier systems, and external quality management platforms, providing controlled access to document subsets while maintaining security and audit requirements. Major customers like GSRTC can access real-time status of documents affecting their product specifications through secure API endpoints, receiving notifications when Control Plans or PFMEAs are updated for their seat models. Supplier integration allows vendors to automatically receive updated drawings and specifications, while maintaining version control and access restrictions based on business relationships. API security includes OAuth2 authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging, with configurable access permissions ensuring external parties receive only appropriate document subsets while protecting proprietary information.

**G-6: Digital Signature Integration (DSC/USB Token)**  
Integration with Indian Digital Signature infrastructure enables legally compliant electronic signatures for critical documents, supporting USB token authentication and DSC verification for regulatory compliance under the IT Act 2000. When PSO signs safety-critical Control Plan CP-2025-0189, the system validates digital certificate authenticity, captures signing timestamp with certificate details, and embeds cryptographic signature into document metadata for tamper verification. Digital signature workflows include certificate expiry monitoring, revocation checking, and automatic notifications for certificate renewal requirements. The system maintains separation between internal e-signatures (for workflow approval) and legal digital signatures (for regulatory compliance), ensuring appropriate signature types are applied based on document classification and intended usage.

**G-7: Auto-Classification of Safety Characteristics**  
Machine learning algorithms analyze document content, process descriptions, and historical safety data to automatically identify and flag safety-critical characteristics requiring PSO oversight, reducing manual classification errors and ensuring consistent safety governance. When Process Engineer creates new Work Instruction for seat belt anchor installation, the AI system identifies keywords like "anchor," "structural," "passenger safety," and "crash performance" to automatically suggest Safety Critical classification and PSO review requirement. The classification engine learns from historical PSO decisions and safety incident correlations to continuously improve accuracy, while maintaining human oversight for all safety determinations. Classification suggestions include confidence scores and reasoning explanations, enabling reviewers to validate AI recommendations and provide feedback for continuous learning improvement.
